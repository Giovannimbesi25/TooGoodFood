# TooGoodFood
Too Good Food is a full-stack project that allows a generic restaurant to offer an online ordering service to its customers. Each customer can access the app via any browser, to see the restaurant menu or register to place an order. Before the order is commissioned, a check is carried out on the products, in order to determine if there are the necessary ingredients for the preparation.
